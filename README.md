# Python Text Adventure (It's Bad, I Promise)

Welcome to the worst text adventure game you'll ever play! This is a **no-UI, low-effort, bad-code** Python project that somehow manages to exist.

## About the Game
This game is a simple text-based adventure with **three scenes**, each offering **three choices**, leading to a grand total of **27 terrible endings**. None of them are good.

Expect:  
- **Awful Code** – You’ve been warned.  
- **Minimal Content** – Just three scenes. That’s it.  
- **Zero Replayability** – Unless you enjoy pain.  
- **A Bad Time** – No refunds. Not that you paid. 

## How to Play
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python adventure.py
   ```
3. Regret everything.

## Why Does This Exist?
Honestly? No idea. But hey, maybe you’ll get a laugh or at least some inspiration on **what not to do** when writing a text-based adventure game.

## Contributing
Please don’t.

## License
No idea. Do whatever you want with it. But credit me if it turn into a big game
